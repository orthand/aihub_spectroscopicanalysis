# Deep Learning for the Analysis of Spectroscopic Data
AI-Hub 2022 Poster Submission

## Abstract
Different measurement techniques in the field of material science generate a large amount of data to evaluate, but still require manual intervention for analysis of the measured signals. For example, in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) measures a crystalline powder sample under varying conditions and generates hundreds of one-dimensional signals. Currently, the evaluation process involves a two-stage approach of identifying different phase variants before a refinement model fits the exact parameters. Alternatively, the use of neural networks for the analysis of powder XRD scans proves highly accurate and applicable for measurement techniques that require high-throughput evaluation methods. Similarly, neural networks have been shown to remove artifacts from the spectroscopic signals and work even for two-dimensional diffraction data. We demonstrate that neural networks are well suited to be used with spectroscopic and diffraction data from different techniques within the material science domain and are looking for projects that generate and provide such data.
